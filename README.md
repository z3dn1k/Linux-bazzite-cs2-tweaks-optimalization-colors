# Linux-bazzite-cs2-increased-vibrance
Some terminal magic and launch option bafoonery to make cs2 more vibrant on bazzite linux.

gamescope -w 1080 -h 1080 -W 1920 -H 1080 -r 320 -S stretch -f --force-grab-cursor -- env ENABLE_VKBASALT=1 %command% -high -novid -fullscreen -----------------------------------------------------------------> Btw there are some launch options that might not work for everybody for example: -r 320 (basicaly sets refresh rate to 320hz so you have to have a 320hz monitor if you dont just set is to whatever or jus tremove it). And i personaly play on 1080 by 1080 resolution so i had to make it so that launch options create and launch with the resoluition so either change this section: gamescope -w 1080 -h 1080 or remove it. Also some launch options increase fps or optimize cs so i would recomend customizing the launch options for your self.

note: might or might not brick your os
