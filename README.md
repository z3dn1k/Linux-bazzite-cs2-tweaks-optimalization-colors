# Linux-bazzite-cs2-increased-vibrance
Some terminal magic to make cs2 more vibrant on linux
Also there are some launch options that might not work for everybody for example: -r 320 (basicaly sets refresh rate to 320hz so you have to have a 320hz monitor if you dont just set is to whatever or jus tremove it) 

note: might or might not brick your os
